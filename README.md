# Project 0 - Google Search Clone

## Introduction

This is a simple web project that includes three HTML files to mimic the functionality and design of Google Search, Images Search, and Advanced Search. The project was developed as a submission for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. More specifically, it is my first submission (Project 0 - HTML and CSS) :)

## HTML Files

The project includes the following HTML files:

1. **index.html**: A clone of the Google Search page.
2. **image_search.html**: A clone of the Google Images Search page.
3. **advanced_search.html**: A minified clone of the Google Advanced Search page.

## CSS Styling

All the styling for the HTML files is done using a single `styles.css` file, which includes the following sections:

1. **Common Styles**: Styles applicable to all HTML files.
2. **Styles for index.html**: Specific styles for the Google Search clone.
3. **Styles for image_search.html**: Specific styles for the Google Images Search clone.
4. **Styles for advanced_search.html**: Specific styles for the Google Advanced Search clone.
5. **Styles for index.html and image_search.html**: Styles applicable to Google Search and Google Images Search clones only.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open any of the HTML files (e.g., index.html) in your web browser to view the Google Search clone.
3. Similarly, open image_search.html and advanced_search.html to view the respective clones.
