# Project 0 - Google Search Clone

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Introduction

This is a simple web project that includes three HTML files to mimic the functionality and design of Google Search, Images Search, and Advanced Search. The project was developed as a submission for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. More specifically, it is my first submission (Project 0 - HTML and CSS) :)

## HTML Files

The project includes the following HTML files:

1. **index.html**: A clone of the Google Search page.
2. **image_search.html**: A clone of the Google Images Search page.
3. **advanced_search.html**: A minified clone of the Google Advanced Search page.

## CSS Styling

All the styling for the HTML files is done using a single `styles.css` file, which includes the following sections:

1. **Common Styles**: Styles applicable to all HTML files.
2. **Styles for index.html**: Specific styles for the Google Search clone.
3. **Styles for image_search.html**: Specific styles for the Google Images Search clone.
4. **Styles for advanced_search.html**: Specific styles for the Google Advanced Search clone.
5. **Styles for index.html and image_search.html**: Styles applicable to Google Search and Google Images Search clones only.
